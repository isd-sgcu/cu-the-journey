    1: "All of CU105s joined Chulalongkorn University, the oldest university in Thailand founded by the royal institution, which claims to be the best in Thailand. It's being challenged and questioned as to why Thailand's education system is still horrible and inequal, when it's got the best faculties. Why did the university's executives support the PDRC (People's Democratic Reform Committee) which destroyed Thailand's democracy, welcomed a prime minister that came from a coup, and destroyed the communities around the university which came before. What will you do with these questions? Would you choose to do nothing? or would you choose to challenge them. Change them. Find the new values of Chula, ones that would not leave anyone in the society behind. This is an important moment for all of you, and the choices you make here will change the society going forward.",
